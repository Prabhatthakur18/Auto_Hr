# Deployment Finish Plan

This file is local memory for the final production rollout. Do not paste real passwords, FTP credentials, JWT secrets, salary keys, or database URLs into this file.

**Status as of 2026-07-06:** Full stack is deployed and verified live:

- Backend: `https://auto-hr-api.vercel.app` (Vercel project `auto-hr-api`, team `prabhatthakurs-projects`). `/api/health` returns 200, DB queries and auth both confirmed working against the real Hostinger MySQL database.
- Frontend: `https://connect.amatoautomotive.co.in` (Hostinger, `/public_html/connect`). Loads correctly, talks to the backend (CORS verified), SPA routing/refresh fixed via `.htaccess`.
- Uploads: **all** file/media uploads across the app (avatars, hero banners, E-Library documents, course thumbnails/module content, learning path thumbnails, announcement media) now go through `putUploadFile` to Hostinger FTP instead of base64-in-DB. Employee documents (private, per-employee, authenticated) go through a separate `putPrivateUploadFile`/`getPrivateUploadFile` pair — stored outside the public webroot (`/private-uploads`, sibling to `public_html`, not reachable by any URL), only ever fetched server-side after an auth check in `documents.ts`, never given out as a direct link.
- A one-time migration (`npm run migrate:storage -- --apply`) converted all pre-existing base64 rows to real uploaded files. See "Known incident" below — worth reading before touching this script again.

The employee user provisioning script (`users:provision`) referenced near the bottom does **not** exist in the repo; that section is a spec for future work, not a completed step.

## Known incident: Git Bash path mangling destroyed test data during migration (2026-07-06)

While running `scripts/migrateBase64ToStorage.ts` from this project's Bash tool (Git Bash / MSYS on Windows), env vars set inline on the command line (e.g. `FTP_REMOTE_ROOT=/connect/uploads node ...`) were **silently rewritten** by MSYS's automatic POSIX-path-to-Windows-path conversion: `/connect/uploads` became `C:/Program Files/Git/connect/uploads`. The FTP client happily created that directory tree on Hostinger and reported success; the DB rows were updated with URLs pointing at the correct intended path (`https://connect.amatoautomotive.co.in/uploads/...`), which doesn't match where the bytes actually went — so every migrated row broke, and clearing the old base64 columns as part of the same "successful" write lost the source content.

**Root cause, in one line:** never set a leading-`/` FTP/path env var inline in a Git Bash command on Windows. Either use PowerShell (confirmed clean — no mangling), or prefix the value with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`, or load it from a real `.env` file via `dotenv`.

**What was actually lost:** all of it was pre-launch test/placeholder content (3 hero banners, 1 library doc, 2 course thumbnails, 2 course module files, 2 announcement media, 1 test employee document) — confirmed with the user, nothing a real employee had uploaded. The broken rows were deleted (HeroBanner, LibraryDocument, AnnouncementMedia) or had just their thumbnail/content URL cleared back to null (Course, CourseModule) so the underlying records survived. One real employee document (Aadhar card, employee 24) was migrated correctly afterward, verified byte-for-byte against the original.

**If this script needs to run again** (e.g. after restoring a DB backup that reintroduces old base64 rows): run it via PowerShell, dry-run first (no `--apply`), and manually verify at least one row's file exists on Hostinger via FTP `list` before trusting the "Migration complete" message.

## Target Setup

- Backend API: Vercel
- Database: Hostinger MySQL
- Static frontend: Hostinger website hosting
- Upload storage: Hostinger FTP-backed public upload folder for public assets such as avatars
- Domain: already configured by owner

## Backend On Vercel

✅ Deployed. Project root: `server`. Live URL: `https://auto-hr-api.vercel.app`.

Vercel entry (zero-config `/api` convention, not the legacy `builds` key):

- `api/index.ts` re-exports the app from `src/vercel.ts` — this is what Vercel actually builds and runs as the serverless function.
- `src/vercel.ts` exports the Express app without `app.listen()` and without schedulers.
- `vercel.json` no longer uses `builds`/`routes` (legacy format skipped TypeScript errors and shipped broken builds — this bit us during setup). It now uses `rewrites` to send `/api/*` to `/api`, plus a no-op `buildCommand` and a placeholder `public/` dir, because this project has no static output — the framework preset otherwise expects one.
- `package.json` has a `postinstall: prisma generate` script. This is required — without it, Vercel's build never generates the Prisma client and every file importing `@prisma/client` types (`Role`, etc.) fails to compile.
- Local `src/index.ts` remains for normal development and starts schedulers. (Unchanged.)

Environment variables — all already set on the Vercel project (Production) via `vercel env add`, values pulled from local `.env` plus the fixes below. Nothing here is stored in this file:

```text
DATABASE_URL              (same Hostinger MySQL URL as local .env)
JWT_SECRET                (regenerated — local .env still has the placeholder, do not reuse it)
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://connect.amatoautomotive.co.in
SALARY_API_KEY / SALARY_ENCRYPTION_KEY   (same as local .env)
SMTP_HOST / PORT / USER / PASSWORD / FROM (same as local .env)
UPLOAD_STORAGE_DRIVER=hostinger-ftp
UPLOAD_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://connect.amatoautomotive.co.in/uploads
FTP_HOST=217.21.90.142
FTP_PORT=21
FTP_USER=u823909847.connect   (Hostinger auto-prefixes the account number — the plain "connect" username shown at account-creation time does NOT work)
FTP_PASSWORD                  (set on Vercel; weak by choice, see Hostinger Upload Storage section)
FTP_SECURE=false
FTP_REMOTE_ROOT=/connect/uploads   (relative to this FTP account's jail root, which is /public_html — "connect" is the existing subfolder serving connect.amatoautomotive.co.in)
```

Notes:

- `JWT_SECRET` on Vercel is a real random 64-byte value, not the `CHANGE_THIS_TO_A_RANDOM_64_CHAR_STRING` placeholder still sitting in local `.env` — don't copy that placeholder into any other environment.
- Use a stable `SALARY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; changing it after salary slips are generated will make existing encrypted values unreadable.
- Vercel serverless should not run interval schedulers. The Vercel entry intentionally avoids `startAnnouncementScheduler`, `startLearningReminderScheduler`, `startLearningAutoAssignScheduler`, and `startCertificateExpiryScheduler`.
- If scheduled jobs are needed in production, move them to Vercel Cron or another always-on job runner.
- `BIOMETRIC_DEVICE_IP` (LAN-only device, `192.168.1.224`) is unreachable from Vercel. The manual attendance-sync endpoint in `server/src/routes/attendance.ts` that uses it will fail if triggered in production — it's not a background job, so it won't crash the server, but the feature itself won't work unless run from a machine on that LAN.
- A stray, unused Vercel project named `server` (auto-created before we renamed to `auto-hr-api`) still exists in the account and can be deleted manually from the dashboard.

## Frontend On Hostinger

Set frontend API URL before building:

```text
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-domain/api
```

Build:

```powershell
cd D:\HR_Project\frontend
npm.cmd run build
```

Upload the contents of:

```text
D:\HR_Project\frontend\dist
```

✅ Deployed. Live at `https://connect.amatoautomotive.co.in`, served from `/public_html/connect` on the Hostinger account (this is the same subfolder later reused as `FTP_REMOTE_ROOT`'s parent for uploads — `connect/uploads`). Uploaded via FTP using the same `u823909847.connect` account as the upload driver.

Built with:

```powershell
cd D:\HR_Project\frontend
$env:VITE_API_URL="https://auto-hr-api.vercel.app/api"
npm run build
```

SPA deep-link/refresh 404s: ✅ fixed. Added `/public_html/connect/.htaccess` with a rewrite-to-`index.html` fallback for any path that isn't a real file/directory. Verified `/dashboard` (and by extension any other client-side route) returns 200 directly, while `/assets/*` and `/uploads/*` still serve as real files/get their own 403-on-listing rule untouched.

To redeploy the frontend after a code change: rebuild with the same `VITE_API_URL`, then FTP-upload the new `dist/` contents into `/connect` (overwriting `index.html` and `assets/`); leave `.htaccess`, `uploads/`, and `default.php` alone.

## Hostinger Upload Storage

✅ Implemented and verified end-to-end (uploaded a real PNG via FTP, fetched it back over HTTPS, got 200 with correct image bytes).

`server/src/utils/uploadStorage.ts` picks local-disk vs Hostinger FTP based on `UPLOAD_STORAGE_DRIVER`. Every public-media route (`avatarStorage.ts`, `heroBanners.ts`, `library.ts`, `learning.ts` course/module/path thumbnails and content, `announcements.ts` media) calls `putUploadFile` instead of inlining base64. Default remains `local` (dev-safe); Vercel is set to `hostinger-ftp`.

On first FTP upload per cold start, the driver also uploads an `.htaccess` with `Options -Indexes` into `FTP_REMOTE_ROOT`, so the uploads folder can't be browsed as a directory listing — only files whose exact (random UUID) name you already have are reachable.

Env vars: see the Vercel section above — same values, this is the same driver.

Expected public URL shape:

```text
https://connect.amatoautomotive.co.in/uploads/avatars/<prefix>-<uuid>.<ext>
https://connect.amatoautomotive.co.in/uploads/hero-banners/<uuid>.<ext>
https://connect.amatoautomotive.co.in/uploads/library/<uuid>.<ext>
https://connect.amatoautomotive.co.in/uploads/course-thumbnails/<uuid>.<ext>
https://connect.amatoautomotive.co.in/uploads/course-modules/<uuid>.<ext>
https://connect.amatoautomotive.co.in/uploads/learning-path-thumbnails/<uuid>.<ext>
https://connect.amatoautomotive.co.in/uploads/announcements/<uuid>.<ext>
```

### Employee documents — private storage, not public uploads

Employee documents (`EmployeeDocument` model, `server/src/routes/documents.ts`) are per-employee, access-controlled, and audited on download — they must never be reachable by a guessable public URL the way avatars are. They use a separate pair of functions in the same file: `putPrivateUploadFile` / `getPrivateUploadFile` / `removePrivateUploadFile`.

- Storage path: `FTP_PRIVATE_REMOTE_ROOT` (`/private-uploads`), a **sibling of `public_html`** on this FTP account's own jail root — not a subfolder of `connect/uploads`, not served by any domain's document root. Even without the `.htaccess`, there is no URL that reaches it.
- Defense in depth anyway: an `.htaccess` with `Require all denied` is uploaded into that folder on first write, same pattern as the public folder's anti-listing `.htaccess`.
- The DB row (`EmployeeDocument.storageKey`) holds only the relative path (e.g. `employee-documents/24/<uuid>.jpg`) — never a URL. `GET /api/documents/:id/download` is the only way to read the bytes: it checks the requester can access that employee's documents (self/team/HR scoping, same as before), fetches the bytes over FTP server-side, and returns them as a `data:` URL in the JSON response — the browser never gets a direct Hostinger link.
- `EmployeeDocument.contentBase64` is now nullable and kept only as a fallback for rows not yet migrated (`storageKey IS NULL`) — `toDownloadPayload()` in `documents.ts` reads from FTP if `storageKey` is set, else falls back to the inline column.

Security notes:

- The FTP account (`u823909847.connect`) is scoped to Hostinger's main `public_html` jail, same as the primary account — it is **not** restricted to only the `connect/uploads` subfolder. A leaked credential could write anywhere under `public_html`, including inside the WordPress install that lives there. Consider asking Hostinger/hPanel whether a home-directory-restricted FTP account is possible for tighter scoping.
- `FTP_SECURE=false` (plain FTP, not FTPS) — credentials and file bytes are sent unencrypted between Vercel and Hostinger on every upload. Password was also kept as user-chosen (`connectHr01`) against a stronger-password recommendation. Both were explicit user calls, not blockers, but worth revisiting if this account's blast radius ever becomes a concern.

## One-time base64 → storage migration script

`server/scripts/migrateBase64ToStorage.ts` (run via `npm run migrate:storage` or `npm run migrate:storage -- --apply`). Converts any remaining `data:mime;base64,...` rows in HeroBanner, LibraryDocument, Course, LearningPath, CourseModule, AnnouncementMedia, and EmployeeDocument into real Hostinger-hosted files, updating each row to point at the new location. Safe to re-run — only touches rows that still look like inline base64/null `storageKey`. **Read the "Known incident" note near the top of this file before running it** — it must be run from PowerShell, not Git Bash, on Windows.

## Employee User Provisioning

❌ Not built. There is no `users:provision` script in `server/package.json` and no matching file in `server/scripts`. The commands and "dry-run result" below are a spec for future work, not something that has run. Treat this whole section as not-yet-implemented until the script actually exists.

Dry run:

```powershell
cd D:\HR_Project\server
npm.cmd run users:provision
```

Apply with a generic password:

```powershell
cd D:\HR_Project\server
npm.cmd run users:provision -- --apply --password="YourGenericPasswordHere"
```

Behavior:

- Creates users only for active employees who do not already have a linked user.
- Existing users are not modified.
- Default role is `EMPLOYEE`.
- Username is generated from employee number, email local-part, biometric id, or name, with collision handling.

Current dry-run result on 2026-07-03:

```text
No active employees without users were found.
```

## Known Fixed Bugs (from this deployment)

- `server/src/config/env.ts` used `z.coerce.boolean()` for `FTP_SECURE`. Zod's coercion does `Boolean(value)` on the raw string, so the literal string `"false"` coerced to `true` (any non-empty string is truthy) — meaning FTPS would have been silently forced on regardless of the env var's actual value, breaking connections to a plain-FTP-only server. Fixed with an explicit `"true"/"false"` enum-to-boolean transform (`booleanString()` helper in the same file). Any other boolean env var added in the future should use the same helper, not `z.coerce.boolean()`.
